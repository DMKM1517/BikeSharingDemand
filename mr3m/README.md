In the context of the DMKM master, a [Kaggle] competition was chosen as a case study, in this case the [Bike Sharing Demand]. The objective of the case study was to put in practice and to develop abilities in the Python programming language, as in libraries such as: numpy, scikit learn and pandas. In this particular approach, explorations using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were made, both in the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as in the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) topology, the later implemented in the Deeplearning library [Tensorflow]. All the code was versioned using git and is available in the repository [github.com/DMKM1517/BikeSharingDemand]
