## Bike rentals prediction

This work is based on the Kaggle competition [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand), with the objective to forecast the useof a city bikeshare system.  Here, I have run some traditional algorithms:  Linear Regression, Time Series and Gradient Boosting, but also Deep Learning (Dense, LSTM, GRU).  The code is in Python, using mainly Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Keras. 

My best model is in the file `best.ipynb` which predicted the file `pred_best.csv`
